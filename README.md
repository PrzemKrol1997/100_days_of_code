# 100_days_of_code
I am following a course on programming in Python and sharing my codes.
In this course, I am doing 100 small projects with gradually increasing difficulty.
In these lessons, when I hear about a final project, I make it work and then watch videos to see if something could be improved.
My favorite lesson so far was day_024 when I made a classic snake game, I modified the code to add music so the game would be more enjoyable.
I was especially proud of day_018 because, using turtle documentation, I believe I have managed to program the project using fewer steps than the authors.
Day 30, during which I learned mostly about error handling, was especially satisfying because I have used those methods in most of my previous projects, and it assured me that I was doing it correctly.
