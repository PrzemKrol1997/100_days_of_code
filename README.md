# 100_days_of_code
I am following a course on programming in Python and sharing my code.
In this course, I am completing 100 small projects with gradually increasing difficulty.
When I hear about a day's final project, I first make it work on my own and then watch the videos to see if anything can be improved.

I started learning how to code to make my life easier and to spend my free time learning something interesting. I had beginner experience in C++ and C.
One thing I knew was possible—and wanted to learn—was how to use Python to save or edit data and create objects with code.

I was especially proud when I finished day 020/021, where I made a classic Snake game that I played as a child, and on day 027 when I built my first clickable program.

Most days, my programs look slightly different from the author's but are similar in complexity. On day_018 and day_025_1, by using documentation, I believe I managed to program the project in an easier way than the author.

To catch mistakes when entering data, I have been using the try and except method from the beginning. I was especially satisfied on day_30 when I confirmed that I was doing it correctly.

The idea for Training_app is what inspired me to start the 100 Days of Code course. I originally recorded my training sessions manually in Notepad, but I thought there must be a better way. I wanted to write a program to automate data entry. I created this program when I learned about saving files, and I plan to update it from time to time to keep it up to date with my knowledge.
